### Genesis 🏛️
April 21, 1997, can be considered as the worst day in the history of music quality. The release of [Winamp](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Winamp) and the rapid rise of the [MP3 format](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3) that came from it began a revolution in accessibility, but it came at a cost: music quality dropped. Lossless releases were encoded to questionable quality by untrained people. Fullband sound went to further plan, and when it resurfaced, it often came with degraded dynamics and equivalent quality. Sometimes worse.

Since 2018 a flood of so-called “sound engineers” trained by YouTube, unaware of even the basics of audio science, has filled — or rather attempted to redefine — the industry with poor recordings and narrowband samples. The true craft of music production has been buried under noise.

This is why I built `axiom` — not to “improve” the sound<sup>1</sup>, but to expose what it **might** be.

> What is the **approximate** frequency cutoff?

> How many channels are actually there?

> Is this high‑res file **really** what it **claims** to be?

<sup>1</sup> - although [it **MAY** upsample](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.resample_poly.html) [fake-lossless](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubinka0505/axiom/refs/heads/master/Documents/Pictures/Spectrograms/Fake.png) files a bit, so I apologize.

### Roadmap 🏁
- [ ] Bug fixing 🐛
- [ ] Writing to multiple files 🔢
- [x] Cross-extension metadata copying 🔀

## Installation 🖥️
1. [`git`](https://git-scm.com) (recommended)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kubinka0505/axiom
cd axiom/Files
python setup.py install
```

2. [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/pip)
```bash
python -m pip install "git+https://github.com/kubinka0505/axiom#egg=axiom&subdirectory=Files" -U --use-deprecated=legacy-resolver
```

## Usage 📝

### Module (simple)
```python
>>> from axiom import Axiom
>>> 
>>> # Create object
>>> axiom_obj = Axiom("HD.flac")
>>> 
>>> # Estimate sample rate
>>> axiom_obj.sample_rate()
{'HD.flac': {'samplerate': 33462, 'cutoff': 16731.298828125}}
>>> 
>>> # Estimate bit depth
>>> axiom_obj.peak()
{'HD.flac': {'bit depth': 10, 'bit depth snapped': 16}
>>> 
>>> # Estimate channels
>>> axiom_obj.channels()
{'HD.flac': {'channels': 2}
>>> 
>>> # Estimate peak
>>> axiom_obj.peak()
{'HD.flac': {'peak': 0.0}
>>> 
>>> # All in one
>>> axiom_obj.aio()
{'HD.flac': {'samplerate': 33462, 'cutoff': 16731.298828125, 'bit depth': 10, 'bit depth snapped': 16, 'channels': 2, 'bitrate': 1070803.125, 'peak': 0.0}}
```

### Module (advanced)
```python
>>> from axiom import Axiom
>>> 
>>> # Files
>>> to_process = [
...     "%UserProfile%/file.mp3",
...     "~/audio.wav",
...     "../song.flac",
...     "sound.ogg",
...     "../files"
... ]
... 
>>> axiom_obj = Axiom(to_process, recursive = True)
>>> 
>>> results = axiom_obj.estimate(
...     start = 10,       # Begin from frame 10
...     duration = "1s",  # Analyze (max) 1 second of file
...     freq_step = 200   # Frequency drop in sample estimation
... )
```
